# Dataset

The dataset was picked up from Kaggle. This is a list of over 34,000 consumer reviews for Amazon products like the Kindle, Fire TV Stick, and more provided by Datafiniti's Product Database. The dataset includes basic product information, rating, review text, and more for each product.

# What i did

Sentimental Analysis was done on the Reviews.rating column in which 1 and 2 reviews were considered Negative, 3 as Neutral and 4 and 5 were assigned to be Positive.
Atlast, I applied Machine Learning Algorithms to see which gives the best accuracy out of all of them.
 The Algorithm Applied were:
 1. Desicion Tree Classifier
 2. Random Forest Classifier
 3. Support Vector Machine Classifier
 4. Multinomial Naive Bayes
 5. Logistic Regression Classifier
